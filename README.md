# plushu-client

Client script for running commands on a plushu Git remote

This script allows you to run `plushu` commands in a Git repository with a
remote that is named "plushu" without having to specify the server.

This imitates the workflow of the Heroku toolbelt, which sends commands to the
Heroku servers for the app specified by the "heroku" remote.

This is just a small convenience command to make this specific use case
slightly less verbose: you don't actually have to install this script to run
commands on a plushu server.
